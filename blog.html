        <h1>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h1>
        <p>localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or
            the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
            sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser
            is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.</p>

        <h1>Difference between global scope and block scope?</h1>
        <p>global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope includes
            all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a
            programmer. A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible
            from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be
            available outside the block even if the block is inside a function.</p>

        <h1>What is Javascript event loop?</h1>
        <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
            collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.</p>
